<h2> Brief Description </h2>

<p>
  Respecc++ is a programming language designed to promote good manners and proper etiquette in our degenerate society. 
  Many programmers nowadays view computers as tools rather than partners. When a cryptic error message is shown, 
  programmers mutter curses and ask the compiler, "What the HECK are you doing today...?" Yet nobody ever asks the 
  compiler, "How are you doing today?" We find this state of affairs to be deplorable, and we hope the creation of 
  Respecc++ will improve human-computer interactions for years to come.
 </p>

<p>
 Although slightly more verbose than some modern languages, Respecc++ boasts an incredibly readable (and respectful) 
 syntactic structure. Additionally, the compiler keeps track of whether any written program is civil or rude and 
 assigns it a numerical value. Considerate code means that at compile time, everything is hunky-dory. However, if a 
 programmer cuts too many corners with "rude" code, the compiler will remember that, *and we cannot promise anything 
 good will come of making the compiler your enemy. 
</p>

<p>
Respecc++ was developed by Timothy Herrmann, Luis Garcia, Joseph Maiocco, Bennett Shingledecker, Kevin McInerney and Kevin Solis in CMSI 488: Language Translation and Implementation at Loyola Marymount University. The course was taught by Dr. Ray Toal during the Spring 2020 semester.

<h2> List of Language Features </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Two syntax styles: Polite (longhand) vs Rude (shorthand), with the ability to mix and match different syntaxes at will. </li>
  <li> A "politeness rating system" that gauges your relationship with the compiler based on the syntax style you adopt most frequently. This discourages programmers from coding too much with the rude syntax. </li>
  <li> Features a global function ***respecc_score()***, allowing users to find out in real time what the compiler truly thinks of them.  </li>
  <li> The compiler keeps track of how much rude syntax a programmer uses. Depending on how rude a programmer is, code may not even compile correctly! </li>
  <li> A strong, dynamic type system that also permits users to manually impose static type restrictions with manifest typing. </li>
  <ul>
    <li> The basic type system contains number, string and boolean primitives, as well as array and dictionary types. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Standard conditional (if, else if, and else) and loop (for, while) statements. </li>
  <li> Recursive functions. </li>
  <li> Anonymous lambda functions and expressions. </li>
  <li> The option to separate statements with newlines or semicolons, allowing multiple statements on a single line. </li>
  <li> More features on the way as development progresses! </li>
</ul>
