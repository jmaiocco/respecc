Hello!

Please declare US_Denominations as a Number as [25, 10, 5, 1].

Favor MakeChange(amount) could you...
  Excuse me, if (amount is less than 0), could you...
    Do me a favor and run print with ("Error").
    Kindly return -1
  Thank You.
  Please declare result as a Array<Number>.
  Please declare remaining as a Number as amount.
  Please declare i as a Number as 0.
  Excuse me, while i is less than 4, could you...
    Please populate result[ i ] with remaining / US_Denominations[ i ].
    Please populate remaining with remaining modded with US_Denominations[ i ].
    i++
  Thank You.
  Kindly return result
Thank You.

Please declare exampleAmount as a Number as 105.
Do me a favor and run MakeChange with (exampleAmount).

Bye Bye!
